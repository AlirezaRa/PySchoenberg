# To find an absolute path of a program in OS X, usually, you need to enter the path to 
# PACKAGE.app/Contents/MacOS/APP. Let's say you've installed Musescore.app in /Applications directory, then the
# path would be /Applications/Musescore.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore. If you've installed it via Homebrew Cask, then
# the path would probably be something line /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/musescore/2.0.1/Musescore\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore.
# To find an absolute path of a program in Linux, assuming you have an executable ready, you need to put the output
# of `which COMMAND`. Let's say you want to enter the absolute path to command `musescore`, then the output of
# `which musescore` would probably be `/usr/bin/musescore` which you need to enter that.

[System]

# Enter the absolute path to MuseScore.
# The executable's name is either `musescore` or `mscore`.
# DO NOT PUT "xdg-open" or "open" instead of an absolute path.

MUSESCORE_PATH = /usr/bin/musescore



# Enter the absolute path to Audiveris. 
# It's optional and only needed if you want to import pdf or jpg.
# DO NOT PUT "xdg-open" or "open" instead of an absolute path.

AUDIVERIS_PATH = /usr/bin/audiveris



# Enter "xdg-open" (without "") if you're on Linux using X11.
# Enter "open" (without "") if you're on OS X to open media files using the default media player.
# You may enter an absolute path, instead, to open up files using a specific program.
